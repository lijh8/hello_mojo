Install

install pixi first
$ curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
The 'pixi' binary is installed into '/Users/ljh/.pixi/bin'
Updating '/Users/ljh/.zshrc'
Please restart or source your shell.
$

Then restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

Navigate to the directory in which you want to create the project and execute:

$ mkdir ~/hello && cd ~/hello

$ pixi init example-project \
  -c https://conda.modular.com/max-nightly/ -c conda-forge \
  && cd example-project
$

Install the Modular Platform from the modular package (which includes Mojo):
$ pixi add modular

checking the version of Mojo:
$ pixi run mojo --version

Start the virtual environment:
$ pixi shell

$ mojo hello.mojo

$ mojo build hello.mojo

$ ./hello

To deactivate your virtual environment:
$ exit


Uninstall

$ pixi remove modular

vscode

extension: mojo by Modular,

when accept input, use internal terminal instead of debug console.
launch.json:
    "runInTerminal": true,

this is similar to golang extension:
    "console": "integratedTerminal",

When install mojo extension in vscode, it will also install or config MAX SDK from Modular.
It seems taht this is not required for build and run mojo at command terminal.

// like c++ class with virtual function
https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/traits/#using-traits ,
Traits solve this problem by letting you define a shared set of behaviors that types can implement.
Then you can write a function that depends on the trait, rather than individual types.


// like c++ template
https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/traits/#generic-structs-with-traits ,
You can also use traits when defining a generic container.
A generic container is a container (for example, an array or hashmap) that can hold different data types.


---


https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#constructors-and-implicit-conversion ,
Implicit conversion can happen when one of the following occurs:
You assign a value of one type to a variable with a different type.
You pass a value of one type to a function that requires a different type.
You return a value of one type from a function that specifies a different return type.


---


https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/values/value-semantics#intro-to-value-semantics ,

In the most basic situation, sharing a value-semantic type means that you create a copy of the value.
This is also known as "pass by value."

We assigned the value of x to y, which creates the value for y by making a copy of x.
When we increment y, the value of x doesn't change. Each variable has exclusive ownership of a value.

Numeric values in Mojo are value semantic because they're trivial types, which are cheap to copy.


https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/values/value-semantics#value-semantics-in-mojo-functions ,

in the following function, the y argument is immutable by default,
so if the function wants to modify the value in the local scope, it needs to make a local copy.

the default behavior for function arguments is fully value semantic: arguments are immutable references,
and any living variable from the callee is not affected by the function.

// __init__:
//      create a new instance not from another existing instance;
//
// __copyinit__, __moveinit__:
//      create a new instance from another existing instance;
//      assignment;
//      function argument passing;

// mojo use init for both creating an instance with initialization, and assignment.
// it does not need separate assignment operator methods like c++.

https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/structs ,

So here it is with a constructor to initialize the two fields,
The __init__() method is one of many special methods
(also known as "dunder methods" because they have double underscores) with pre-determined names.

Once you have a constructor, you can create an instance of MyPair and set the fields.


https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#copy-constructor ,
When Mojo encounters an assignment statement that doesn't use the transfer sigil (^),
it tries to make a copy of the right-side value by calling upon that type's copy constructor,

Mojo also calls upon the copy constructor when a value is passed to a function that takes the argument as owned
and when the lifetime of the given value does not end at that point.

If the lifetime of the value does end there (usually indicated with the transfer sigil ^),
then Mojo instead invokes the move constructor.


---


https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#move-constructor ,
the only catch is that you must use the ^ transfer sigil to end the lifetime of a move-only type
when assigning it to a new variable or when passing it as an owned argument.


---


https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#value-decorator ,
even if it's not used with self.name = name^, the Mojo compiler will notice
that name is last used here and convert this assignment into a move, instead of a copy+delete.

// file handle, network and database connection, are non-memory (eg. variables) resources.
// it is like using a custom deleter with c++ smart pointer.
https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/errors#use-a-context-manager ,
A context manager is an object that manages resources such as files, network connections,
and database connections.


---


https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/packages#mojo-modules ,
import MyPair into a file named main.mojo that's in the same directory as mymodule.mojo:
  from mymodule import MyPair

it only works when mymodule.mojo is in the same directory as main.mojo.
Currently, you can't import .mojo files as modules if they reside in other directories.
That is, unless you treat the directory as a Mojo package, as described in the next section.
